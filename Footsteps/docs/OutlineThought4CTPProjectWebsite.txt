Brainstorming ideas for the Pet-Walking service of our CTP proposal: 
- PetFriend (Frank)
- PetAngels (Elvis)
- FootSteps (Nujoma)



-----
Features of our app: 
- Dog Walking Service (using google maps to locate nearby dog walkers)
- Dog Walking Signup  (using open source database of criminals 
to approve new users to become dog walkers.) 
- Dog Emergency (using google maps to locate nearby users, and nearby 
dog hospital services.)
- Dog Grooming (Additional feature in order to keep your dog looking
sharp.)

1. Dog grooming,  and 2. Dog emergency.


So for a scenario with the grooming. Let's say we have a user, 
that is at home, and has a dog that they would love to give a haircut 
too, but are too uninformed about where to go to get their dog groomed.
Our website will make it easy for them, by simply doing a simple 
search, and possibly clicking a button, to order a certified dog 
groomer to come to your door and take care of your dog needs. It can 
be as simple as ordering dominos pizza, or an uber.

For a scenario 
with the emergency. In the case where you are unable to take your dog
to a hospital, it would be nice to have someone available and willing
through your app to take your dog to the hospital. Since we are using
the Google Maps API, we will be able to easily mark down the closest
animal hospitals in the area and have any available dog walker, or 
even groomer that is willing and trusted to take your dog to said 
hospital.
